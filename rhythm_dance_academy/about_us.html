                <h2>Radhika Sonar - Principal</h2>
                <p> I started dancing since i was 3 years old at India before moving to Perth. Dancing is the only thing i can do my whole life. 
                    I grew up doing dance and participating in different dance competitions before becoming a dance teacher.
                    Dancing has always been my passion and now I’m extremely lucky to get to do what I love everyday as my job. 
                    Now all I want to do is share the love and excitement that dance brings with everyone I can. 
                    I pride myself on creating a space where everyone feels welcome and has a chance to dance because there is nothing better to do than dance! </p>
